        <h1>AudioController Class Testing</h1>
        <p>This page is designed to test the functionality of the AudioController class.</p>
        <p>Instructions for loading audio Media using AudioController:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Load the media file given a URL to the file:</td>
                <td><button id="load_button">Load Media</button></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Start the AudioController class:</td>
                <td><button id="start_button">Start Media</button></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. AudioController is now operational:</td>
                <td>
                    <button id="play_button">Play/Pause</button>
                    <input type="range" id="time_range" min="0" max="100" value="0">
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td>4. The controller can be stopped eventually:</td>

        <h2>Event Testing Description</h2>
        <p>
            View the console dubugger in the browser to view the testing 
            outputs. 
            <br><br>

            There are events that trigger during specific time intervals that 
            simply state how much time has passed. These events occur at: 
            <br><br>

            1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4.5 seconds, and 20 seconds.
            <br><br><br>

            To test simultaneous events, there is another event a 1 second that
            will execute at the same time as the previous event at 1 second. It
            has the following message:
            <br><br>

            "Simultaneous event at 1 second"
            <br><br>

            The "Load Media" button can also be pressed multiple times to reload
            the time events. Each time event message will be repeated
            simultaneously by the amount of time the button has been clicked.
            <br><br><br>

            To test continuous events, there is one continuous event that occurs
            at the very beginning of the timeline (0 seconds). There is another
            continuous event that occurs at 60 seconds. These events print a
            message to say if the current time of the timeline is before or
            after 1 minute. This is printed to the console whenever the user
            manually changes time.
