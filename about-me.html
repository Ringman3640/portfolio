                    Hello! I am Franz Alarcon, a 21-year-old Filipino American
                    pursuing a career in the computer science field. My current
                    interests include application/desktop programming and game
                    development. However, I am willing to learn and explore a
                    wide variety of fields in the industry.

                    My first introduction to higher education was through 
                    the Running Start program, where I attended Everett
                    Community College (EVCC) for a year. After I graduated from
                    high school, I continued to attend EVCC for an additional
                    year. 
                    <br><br>

                    After completing all necessary prerequisite courses, I
                    transferred to the University of Washington Bothell campus
                    under the Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)
                    major. I will graduate with a CSSE bachelor's degree after
                    the Fall 2023 quarter.

                <p>
                    During my time at university, I took several CSSE courses
                    to cover a wide variety of fields. The following is a list
                    of some of the courses I completed:

                    <br>
                    From these courses, I completed multiple assignments and
                    projects that helped my gain experience in various
                    programming tasks and languages. One of my favorite class
                    assignments was a group project to 
                    <a href="/projects/outbreak-pto.html">
                        develop a video game
                    </a>.
                    <br><br>

                    Outside of school, I also work on various personal
                    projects. Some of these include a 
                    <a href="/projects/console-menu.html">

                    and 
                    <a href="https://github.com/Ringman3640/PowerMeter">
                        custom addons for video games
