                    Hello! I am Franz Alarcon, a 21-year-old Filipino American
                    pursuing a career in the computer science field. My current
                    interests include application/desktop programming and game
                    development. However, I am willing to learn and explore a
                    wide variety of fields in the industry.

                    My first introduction to higher education was through 
                    the Running Start program, where I attended Everett
                    Community College (EVCC) for a year. After I graduated from
                    high school, I continued to attend EVCC for an additional
                    year. 
                    <br><br>

                    After completing all necessary prerequisite courses, I
                    transferred to the University of Washington Bothell campus
                    under the Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)
                    major. I will graduate with a CSSE bachelor's degree after
                    the Fall 2023 quarter.

                <p>
                    During my time at university, I took several CSSE courses
                    to cover a wide variety of fields. The following is a list
                    of some of the courses I completed:

                <p>
                    <br>
                    From these courses, I completed multiple assignments and
                    projects that helped my gain experience in various
                    programming tasks and languages. One of my favorite class
                    assignments was a group project to 
                    <a href="/projects/outbreak-pto.html">
                        develop a video game
                    </a>.
                    <br><br>

                    Outside of school, I also work on various personal
                    projects. Some of these include a 
                    <a href="/projects/console-menu.html">
                        C++ console GUI
                    </a>
                    and 
                    <a href="https://github.com/Ringman3640/PowerMeter">
                        custom addons for video games

                    Why Computer Science?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    I fell in love with the practice of programming when I
                    started playing LittleBigPlanet 2 as a child. The
                    LittleBigPlanet game series allows players to create their
                    own levels and has its own logic system similar to block
                    programming. I was facinated by the ability to develop
                    complex abilities and behaviors from scratch and addicted to
                    watching the whole system slowly come together into a
                    complex, interwoven machine. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <div id="logic-gallery-container" class="image-gallery-container">
                    <h3>My LittleBigPlanet Logic Examples</h2>
                    <div id="logic-gallery" class="image-gallery"></div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <br>
                    I eventually got into language-based programming in my
                    freshman year of high school in an introductory computer
                    science class. I learned how to write very simple HTML and
                    CSS websites, along with a small amount of Javascript. It
                    was the most fun I had in a high school course, abeit helped
                    by my friends' company.
                    <br><br>

                    I wouldn't delve too deeply into developing my programming
                    skills until I began Running Start. Everett Community
                    College provided multiple introductory computer science
                    courses that I knew I wanted to join from my past
                    experiences. Since then, I have drastically improved my
                    programming skills and knowledge.
                    <br><br>

                    Computer programming, to me, is the act of solving problems
                    and developing solutions by instructing computers on what
                    to do. Every problem is a puzzle that needs to be analyzed
                    and solved. This process of solving complex problems and
                    watching as a solution slowly begins to develop is an
                    amazing feeling for me.
                    <br><br>

                    This is why I choose computer science.
