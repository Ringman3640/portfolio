                <p>
                    Console Menu (abbreviated as CONU) is a C++ GUI library that
                    operates within the default C++ console window. CONU allows
                    for the development of dynamic user interfaces that respond
                    to mouse and keyboard input, such as Menu systems,
                    interactive programs, and games.
                    <br><br>

                    This project was developed as a personal project to create
                    a GUI library. Development and planning began May, 2022 and 
                    CONU v1.1 was released June, 2023. Development occurred
                    intermittently over this period.

                <div class="section-underline"></div>

                <h3>Not Enough Initial Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    I was constantly changing class interfaces for base classes
                    throughout development, which took up a lot of time. This
                    could have been avoided if I spend more time planning
                    before developing any interfaces.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>WinAPI</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my first dive into the Windows API, which was a
                    significant learning curve. I spent a lot of time 
                    troubleshooting.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Console Window Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                    The default C++ console window is not actually owned by
                    the program. Rather, it is executed as a separate process.
                    This prevented me from adding beneficial features involving 
                    hooks.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Lack of Library Development Knowledge</h3>
                <p>
                    I had very minimal library design knowledge initially. This
                    was detrimental when issues would latter appear, such as the
                    problem of distributing a static library file built using a
                    specifc compiler version.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p><br></p>

            <div id="conu-what-i-learned" class="main-section-group">
                <h2 class="section-text">What I Learned</h2>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>

                <h3>General Development Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I would consider this my first programming project that is
                    considerably complex. This is compared to more basic
                    programming assignment and personal projects.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Interface Change is Expensive</h3>
                <p>
                    Changing the interface for a class mid-development is very
                    time expensive, especially if the class is a base class. It
                    is very important to plan-out class interfaces ahead of time
                    to prevent the need to change them later.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Introduction to the Windows API</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involved me using the Windows API for the first
                    time. I was able to learn some basic knowledge of how the
                    API works, such as how windows and errors are handled.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Windows Hooking</h3>
                <p>
                    When researching on how to implement certain features for
                    the library, I learned about Window's hooking system. This
                    system inspired me to implement the input hook system in
                    CONU.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Static vs Dynamic Linked Libraries</h3>
                <p>
                    Troubleshooting the issues with static libraries taught me
                    about both static and dynamic libraries. Should I remake
                    this project, I would likely try to implement it as a DLL.
