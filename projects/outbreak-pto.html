                    Outbreak-PTO is a top-down action shooter videogame that
                    uses a pixel-art style. The premise of the game is to
                    survive on an infested space-ship and fight through various
                    enemies. The end-goal is to defeat the game's final boss.
                    <br><br>

                    The project was created as an assignment for our
                    introductory game development class. This game served as the
                    final project for the course. 
                    <br><br>
                    
                    As part of the assignment, the game had a central theme that
                    all groups in the class needed to follow. This theme was
                    "potatoes". We implemented this idea into our game by
                    creating potato enemies that fought against the character.

            <div id="outbreak-pto-my-part" class="main-section-group">
                <h2 class="section-text">My Work</h2>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>
                <p>
                    During development of the game, my primary roles were as
                    the player character designer and the main gameplay
                    programmer. I was responsible for implementing most of the
                    gameplay systems within Unity, such as the player character
                    controls, player interactions, weapon functionality, and 
                    other general gameplay systems. I also designed the base
                    health systens and enemy detection systems, but did not
                    work on all the the enemy behavior implementations.
                    <br><br>

                    My other responsibility, as mentioned above, was as the
                    player character designer. I produced all art and animations
                    for the playable character and for other areas such as 
                    enemies and tiles. 
                    <br><br>

                    My last task for the project was to create the trailer video
                    which can be watched above.
                    <br><br>

                    Here's some galleries of some of the animation and art
                    assets I created.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <div id="character-gallery-container" class="image-gallery-container">
                    <h3>Character Assets</h2>
                    <div id="character-gallery" class="image-gallery"></div>
                </div>

                <a><br><br></a>

                <div id="other-gallery-container" class="image-gallery-container">
                    <h3>Other Assets</h3>
                    <div id="other-gallery" class="image-gallery"></div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, not all of the assets we made were included
                    in the final game. Due to time contstraints, we did were not
                    able to plan where to use these assets I made.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <div id="unused-gallery-container" class="image-gallery-container">
                    <h3>Unused Assets</h3>
                    <div id="unused-gallery" class="image-gallery"></div>
                </div>
                
            </div>

            <div id="outbreak-pto-went-well" class="main-section-group">
                <h2 class="section-text">What Went Well</h2>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>

                <h3>Overall Quality</h3>
                <p>
                    I consider the overall experience we created for the game to
                    be high quality. I'm really proud of what we were able
                    to create.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Our group was able to communicate very well during stressful
                    parts of development. We never had any personal issues with 
                    each other.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Coordination</h3>
                <p>
                    To work efficiently, we split up the work into seperate,
                    individual sections. For the most part, each individual
                    system we created worked well when congregated.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Cooperation</h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone on our team put their best efforts down for the
                    project. We all pulled our weight and worked to get things
                    done on time. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, three months is not a lot of time to develop a
                    game. We needed to scrap some planned features and
                    prioritize other features. During this deliberation time,
                    we were able to efficiently decide what was necessary and
                    what we could disregard.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-text">Problems We Faced</h2>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>
                <h3>Git Merges</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a BIG issue. None of us were very well-aquainted
                    with Git, so we were unsure of how to manage Git merge
                    collisions. We ended up manually dealing with merge issues
                    and performing force pushes which was a frustrating
                    process.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Not Enough Time</h3>
                <p>
                    When we started planning out game, we were really ambitious
                    and considered a lot of features. We didn't realize how
                    short three months was for game development and were
                    dissapointed when we had to cut ideas.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    There are noticable frame drops when playing our game on
                    occasion. I attempted to implement an obtimization unloading
                    system, but the impact seemed minimal. We were unable to 
                    find the cause of the slowdown because of time constraints.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>System Complexity</h3>
                <p>
                    The systems I implemented for animation and weapon controls
                    are really complex, making it difficult to maintain and
                    modify. 
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2 class="section-text">What I learned</h2>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>
                <h3>General Group Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was the first time I've every worked in a group
                    for a programming project. I gained experience from working
                    with my group members and teaching them about my system
                    implementations.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>C# Language and Unity</h3>
                <p>
                    Unity was my first introduction to the C# language. From
                    what I used, I really liked the syntax and would definitely
                    consider using it again. The documentation for C# and Unity
                    were also amazing. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>Game Dev is Fun!</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was the most fun I've had in a class project. I
                    was completely invested in what I was doing and the end
                    result was very satisfying!
