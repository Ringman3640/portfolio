                <p>
                    The CARLA Platoon System is an implementation of automated
                    longitudinal control within a vehicle platoon. It was
                    developed within the CARLA simulator and programming with
                    Python using CARLA's Python API.
                    <br><br>

                    This project was started as an individual assignment for an
                    automated vehicles course at university. The total
                    development time, including research and implementation, was
                    approximately one month.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="carla-platoon-how-it-works" class="main-section-group">
                <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>
                <p>
                    In a vehicle platoon, there are two types of vehicels: the
                    lead vehicle and following vehicles. The lead vehicle is the
                    vehicle at the front of the platoon formation. It is
                    manually controlled and directs the whole platoon. Following
                    vehicles are any vehicles behind the lead vehicle. Following
                    vehicles are completely automated.
                    <br><br>

                    When the platoon is spawned into the CARLA simulated world,
                    the lead vehicle is given several path options. Based on the
                    selected path, the lead vehicle will start accelerating
                    while broadcasting its movements to the following vehicles
                    using a simple Python echo server.
                    <br><br>

                    Following vehicles will attempt to syncronize with the lead
                    vehicle's movements. Each individual following vehicle will
                    also act independently if it detects it is too close or too
                    far from the vehicle in front of it. Other following
                    vehicles will be notified of any corrective movements.
                </p>

                <p><br></p>

                <div id="demo-gallery-container" class="image-gallery-container">
                    <h3>Demonstrations</h2>
                    <div id="demo-gallery" class="image-gallery"></div>
                </div>

            <div id="carla-platoon-results" class="main-section-group">
                <h2 class="section-title">Final Results</h2>
                <p>
                    The platoon model has shown the ability for following
                    vehicles to react to movements from the lead vehicle and
                    other nearby following vehicles...
                    <br><br>

                    ...albeit a high chance of collisions.
                    <br><br>

                    Following vehicles have a significant chance of colliding
                    with their front vehicle when a braking maneuver is taking
                    place. This is exacerbated as the number of vehicles in the
                    platoon increases. Typically, a following vehicle may speed
                    up if they are lagging behind the platoon. However, if the
                    platoon starts braking, then the speeding following vehicle
                    will be too fast and cause a collision.
                    <br><br>

                    A marjor limitation of this platooning model is the lack of
                    automated lateral control. Following vehicles only perform
                    acceleration movements automatically. They do not account
                    for steering.

                <h2 class="section-title">Development Issues</h2>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">CARLA Ease-Of-Use</h3>
                <p>
                    I have personally be spoiled since I have only been exposed
                    to well-documented tooling so far. CARLA was a slap to
                    reality as the first environment I have used with very
                    minimal, auto-generated documentation pages.
                    <br><br>

                    CARLA also doesn't have a lot of convenience methods in its
                    API. This made it impossible to fine-tune the automated
                    vehicle controls since I had no knowledge or experience with
                    PID controllers at the time. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">CARLA Build Time</h3>
                <p>
                    It takes several hours to setup and build the CARLA
                    simulator. This is because the simulation and other
                    necessary resources are multiple gigabytes in size. The
                    setup also requires building a custom version of the Unreal
                    Engine.
                    <br><br>

                    The long build time made me hesitate to mess with modifying
                    anything in the CARLA world. I didn't want to risk breaking
                    something and needing to rebuild the project. This
                    ultimately prevented me from creating a custom testing map.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Unreal Engine Complexity</h3>
                <p>
                    I expected Unreal Engine to be relatively simple to
                    understand coming from Unity. However, there were
                    significant differences that prevented me from being able to
                    easily add a custom CARLA sensor to the simulation. I
                    ultimately had to drop the sensor idea for time reasons.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">First Time With Python</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was my first time using Python. I spend a lot
                    of time going through the documentation of libraries. My
                    code organization was also very cluttered.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Focus On Other Project</h3>
                <p>
                    At the time I was working on the platoon system, I was also
                    working on another project (hint: you're looking at it). I
                    prioritized that other project, leaving me with less time to
                    research and develop the platoon system.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Searching Source Code</h3>
                <p>
                    I needed to search through the CARLA C++ source code to
                    learn more about specific methods. Gave me experience in
                    using soure code for research.

                <h3 class="subsection-title">AV Platoon Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    The process of implementing a custom platoon system taught
                    me about the process and complexities of vehicle automation.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Python</h3>
                <p>
                    I experienced using Python for the first time and learned
                    about some basic libraries. 
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Documentation Reality Check</h3>
                <p>
                    Before this project, I have used tooling and environments
                    that provide documentation on a silver platter. Using CARLA
                    showed me that not all tools will have amazing 
                    documentation and resources. I need to do my own testing and
                    research.
